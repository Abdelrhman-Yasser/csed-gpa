This calculator is a new version (with a stylish touch using Angular.js and Bootstrap) of Eng. Amr Kabardy's calculator created in 2008, you can check the original calculator page in [index-old.html](http://hazemsamir.github.io/csed-gpa/old-index.html).


This page provide a simple calculator that you can use to get your GPA and calculations are based on instructions and points stated in [Egypt Scholars Inc](http://egyptscholars.org/) [Study Abroad Guide](http://egyptscholars.org/study-abroad-guide/) section#4.
