If you don't know what is GPA "Grade Point Average", please visite [this page](http://amrkabardy.blogspot.com/2007/03/gpa-grade-point-average.html) first.

This page provide a simple calculator that you can use to get your GPA and calculations are based on instructions and points stated in [this post](http://amrkabardy.blogspot.com/2007/03/gpa-grade-point-average.html). The calculator is not generic and is statically made for being used by my colleagues.

- This document is intended for Students of Alexandria University, Faculty of Engineering, Computer and Systems Engineering Department. The calculator is created based on the course plan that started to be applied since the academic year 2003-2004. It is a subjct to be changed by the faculty. I did my best to get the results correctly :), you are responsible of revising your GPA if you think there is an error.
- Be careful if you will include preparatory year. It may be suitable for 2008 graduates only in this case. Even your class is considering the 2003/2004 course plan, I got some information that some subjects were added later to preparatory year. So, check if the preparatory year subjects are yours or you take more subjects! And decide weather to include preparatory year or not :)

GPA Settings
------------
Before this section, you were forced to use the static points assigned to each grade (which were obtained from this page. Last Accessed on September 23, 2008). From now on, you can set your preference of points attached to each grade. If you are applying for a university that maps "Very Good" to 3 Points instead of the default3.5, you can change it to your prefered value.

**Notes:**

    - To use this feature, fill in your prefered grade points in the following table.
    - Each Row represents: (1) The grade, (2) The default grade points, and (3) Your prefered setting for the grade points.
    - Leave your preferred value empty to use the default.
    - Grade Points are constrained to: (1) Between 0 and 4 inclusive. (2) Either Integer or Floating Point number.
    - WRONG GRADE POINTS will be DISCARDED and Default will be used instead.
